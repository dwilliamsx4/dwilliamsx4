- 👋 Hi, I’m @dwilliamsx4 (newbie)
- I started to educate myself about Linux/Ubuntu about 6 months ago. With my friend Gil's help, I converted my HP laptop to Ubuntu!
- I found the Pine64 site last month and purchased a pinephone(I have not received it yet).
- I purchased a PineTime Dev Kit because it had a sealed watch i could use for running (training for a marathon this october).
- I just updated the Pinetime to the latest infinitime 1.2.0 - A big thanks to everyone working on this!
- I also purchased a Pinepower and pinecil (i like them both)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about PineTime/InfiniTime and Pinephone(when I receive it).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate Github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - learning how to provide support/feedback as a PineTime/Pinephone user. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Please leave a comment here
